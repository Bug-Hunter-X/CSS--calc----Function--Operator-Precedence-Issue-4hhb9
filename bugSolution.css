The solution is to use parentheses to force the correct order of operations:

```css
.container {
  width: calc((50% - 10px));
}
```

This version ensures that 10px is subtracted from 50% of the *available* width *before* the percentage is calculated.  The use of parentheses makes the calculation unambiguous and guarantees the expected outcome.
