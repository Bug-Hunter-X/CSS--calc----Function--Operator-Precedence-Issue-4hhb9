The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an issue related to the usage of the `calc()` function with percentages and incorrect operator precedence:

```css
.container {
  width: calc(50% - 10px);
}
```

The problem is that the calculation might not produce the expected result if the `- 10px` part needs to be calculated before the percentage.  In this case, the browser might first calculate 50% of the parent container and then subtract 10px from that result. However, if you intended to subtract 10px from 50% of the *available* width before calculating the percentage, the result would be different and inaccurate.

This demonstrates the importance of operator precedence and the need for parentheses to explicitly define the order of operations within the `calc()` function.
